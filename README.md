### How I build this
I build this website is basicly use particle js for the background and I set to cyan color because I lately like that color.

This is just simple and just like another simple website. You can look into its source code. To make the box in the center of particle js, the div must be absolute position and make it simple, not needs many space.

### Contribute
If you see something weird in this website you can contribute to fix them. Here's the simple way:
- Fork it
- Make your own branch (`git checkout -b your-branch`)
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m "update .... "`)
- Push to your branch (`git push -u origin your-branch`)
- Create new Pull Request
